## Introduction: Our project aims to determine the best dataset in Pittsburgh. We used this dataset based on the datasets made available to us from WPRDC. In a time where a pandemic is impacting all of us, we thought it was important to include a dataset relevant to COVID-19. This is one of the data sets we choose to include when deciding the best neighborhood. Exercise is also important to overall health and something that represents such data is stairwells. Lastly, air quality is also important when it comes to a disease that impacts the lungs. For this reason we chose to look at which neighborhood had the most trees. From this we hope to pinpoint the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

## Metrics: the most number of stairways, the least number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, the most number of trees. The links to the datasets we used are in the README above. 

## Best Neighborhood: Squirrel Hill

## Conclusion: After looking at all of our datasets, we were able to conclude that Squirrel Hill is the best neighborhood in Allegheny County. We came to this conclusion after seeing that the cases and the deaths are very low compared to the population size of the neigborhood, this neighborhood also consisted of more stairways than a majority of other neighborhoods, and it also consisted of the most trees in the county. From this we can see a correlation between exercise(stairways) and health related to COVID-19 cases as well as air quality(trees).
